    title: "Philosophy",
    text: `It is not intended to dictate the structure by which each group is organised, but there are some guidelines that can aid in the effectiveness of their ministry. Therefore, it is strongly advised that these guidelines be taken seriously and only deviated from should it be clear that another approach is necessary or would in all likelihood be more effective.`

    title: "What is the PDA?",
    text: `The Prayer Discipleship Academy is a framework through which the Holy Spirit trains men and women to pray and develops in them a serious devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ.

For more detail, please watch all our introductory videos and familiarise yourself with our distinctives and structure.`
  },
  {
    title: "What part does Scripture play?",
    text: `Although the PDA is a "prayer" discipleship academy, Scripture plays a crucial role. We focus on prayer because it is an essential element in understanding and applying the word. However, without the word, we would not know what to pray or the God through whom we pray. Prayer is ineffective without the word, and the word is incomplete without prayer. To be effective in both word and prayer, we must grow in both.

The reason the PDA does not include teaching or training in the word is that this is the responsibility of your elders within the context of a local church. Additionally, there are many valuable resources available today for biblical studies. However, there are very few initiatives that train men and women in prayer, and so this is our focus.

Through the guidance of the Holy Spirit within the PDA framework, you will be led into a deeper devotional life, rooted in personal devotion to both the word and prayer. You will become more intimately connected with the word through reading, studying, meditation, and memorization, making it an integral part of your life. Your prayer life will be enriched and more effective, thereby maximizing the fruitfulness of your time spent in the Bible.`

    title: "Requirements for members?",
    text: `Agree with and hold to the Statement of Faith.

Be a born-again, baptised believer and a member in good standing of a Bible-believing, Trinitarian church.

Commit to attending each meeting (Distinctive One).

Commit to the Spirit’s sanctifying work and to the personal development necessary to become a serious man or woman of prayer (Distinctive Two).

Commit to implementing Total War and seeking the Lord’s help to progressively apply it in your Christian walk (Distinctive Three).`
  },
  {
    title: "Requirements for facilitators?",
    text: `Meet all the requirements for a member.

Facilitate the meetings in the spirit of this work, upholding and inspiring others to pursue all our distinctives, and, when necessary and with grace, remove from participation those who hinder the work through disruption or slothfulness.

Agree to pray regularly and often for myself, so that I may facilitate the meetings powerfully by the Holy Spirit.

Agree to pray regularly and often for future facilitators to be raised up from among the members with the same spirit.

Agree to pray regularly and often for each member, that they may grow in sanctification and zeal in prayer.

Agree to pray regularly and often for the advancement of this ministry and for God to be glorified through it.

Strive to remain at least one step ahead of the other members in maturity, spiritual devotion, and fervour, and be able to graciously admonish, exhort, and inspire them.

If, by God’s providence, someone added to the group—or someone already within the group—surpasses me in maturity, spiritual devotion, and fervour, then I should prayerfully consider stepping down and handing over facilitation in due time.`
  },
  {
    title: "What time should we prayer?",
    text: `A time should be chosen that allows the group to meet without interference from daily responsibilities. The commitment is ultimately to the Lord, not merely to one another. Just as no one would miss a meeting with an earthly monarch except in a life-threatening emergency, how much more should we prioritise meeting with the King of Heaven? A time between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. is recommended, as our Lord often met with His Father during these hours.

Once a time is set, it should not be changed unless circumstances genuinely require it and a more profitable time is chosen. At all costs, we must avoid changing the meeting time on an ad hoc basis, as this undermines our first distinctive of sacrificial commitment—even when it causes personal inconvenience or discomfort. If this seems too extreme, then this path may not be right for you at this time.`
  },
  {
    title: "How often should we pray?",
    text: `Groups must meet regularly, though care must be taken to avoid asceticism and self-righteousness. Self-denial is important but must be Spirit-led, not imposed. New members may be at different stages of growth, so meeting once a week is strongly advised, with the possibility of more frequent meetings for established groups during times of intense spiritual warfare.`
  },
  {
    title: "What duration should the meeting be?",
    text: `The length of each meeting depends on group size, meeting frequency, schedules, and the season of prayer. Because ascetic tendencies can emerge, meetings are best kept between one and two hours. Length may be adjusted when necessary. If significant discussion is included, meeting length should increase proportionally. Ideally, long discussions should be held at another time so that meetings focus primarily on prayer.`
  },
  {
    title: "Where should we meet?",
    text: `Meeting in person is ideal, though online gatherings are acceptable when distance makes in-person meetings impractical. However, using platforms with time limits is strongly discouraged, as forced interruptions can disrupt the flow and effectiveness of prayer.

It is imperative that you only meet with individuals you personally know and whose character you are confident in.`
  },
  {
    title: "What size should a group be?",
    text: `Groups should consist of a facilitator and up to five other members. This ensures everyone can participate meaningfully in prayer. When the group reaches six people, two separate groups should be formed.`
  },
  {
    title: "Who can be a member?",
    text: `Anybody who holds to our Statement of Faith, is a member in good standing of a local Bible-believing, Trinitarian church, and has committed to abide by our distinctives. Group facilitators must consider group membership wisely to ensure that harmony is maintained.`
  },
  {
    title: "What about theological distinctives?",
    text: `Members must refrain from promoting theological positions within the group. While doctrinal understanding influences prayer, grace should be extended, remembering that members are praying to God, not to each other. Ecumenicism among Bible-believing Christians is biblical and essential for powerful, effective prayer.`
  },
  {
    title: "Should groups be single-sex?",
    text: `Groups do not need to be single-sex, though there may be advantages to doing so. Some prayer topics might not be appropriate in mixed groups. In addition, unmarried individuals of the opposite sex should not meet in person alone—and preferably not online either—unless it is clearly evident that this would not present any issues.`
  },
  {
    title: "How should people be recruited?",
    text: `The recruitment of members is critical. Individuals must possess spiritual dispositions that align with the purpose of the work. The enemy will attempt to discourage and divide, so facilitators must rely on God’s guidance rather than human wisdom when discerning whom to recruit. Prayer for God’s direction is therefore foundational to the recruitment process.`
  },
  {
    title: "Should we publicise the work?",
    text: `Because God selects recruits, the work should not be overtly publicised. Many people are drawn to prayer initiatives in the flesh, and their enthusiasm fades quickly. This work requires calling, anointing, and genuine divine leading.`
  },
  {
    title: "How are new groups formed?",
    text: `Each member should eventually facilitate their own group. Ideally, a group reaches a total of six members before dividing, with a mature member stepping into the role of facilitator for the new group. A facilitator may oversee multiple groups if they are able.

The selection of a new facilitator is crucial, as their conduct and spiritual maturity will directly influence the group members. It is better to grow slowly than to promote prematurely.`
  },
  {
    title: "Can people be removed?",
    text: `To continue in the work, each member must continue to uphold our Statement of Faith, remain a member of a Bible-believing, Trinitarian church, and maintain our distinctives.

If a facilitator determines that one or more of these requirements is no longer being met, they have the right to prevent that person from attending further meetings. It is not our desire for this to occur, and there may be many reasons why a member is struggling in one or more areas. In such cases, the facilitator should exercise grace tempered with wisdom.

If, after a reasonable period of grace, a member still fails to uphold these requirements, the preferred approach is a mutual agreement for them to step down. However, if they refuse to do so, the facilitator will ask them to leave until they are able to continue while meeting the necessary requirements.`
  },
  {
    title: "What if I can no longer continue?",
    text: `There may be circumstances beyond a member’s control that prevent them from upholding our distinctives. As much as we would like for that member to continue with us, the effectiveness of this work depends entirely on our distinctives, which maintain the spiritual framework essential for the ministry. Therefore, it may be necessary for that member to step aside temporarily, with the hope that circumstances will change and they can rejoin the work in the future.`
  },
  {
    title: "What is the spiritual accountability?",
    text: `Each group is autonomous and accountable to the Lord alone. However, maintaining a loose connection between groups strengthens mutual encouragement. We encourage new facilitators to register with us by sending their contact details via email (see the Resources page). This allows us to share any helpful information and to connect those who enquire through the website or app with a suitable group.`
  },
  {
    title: "Where can I report problems?",
    text: `It is to be expected that as this work bears fruit for the kingdom, our adversary the devil will seek to disrupt it. His primary target is the interpersonal relationships between Christians—hence our Lord’s prayer for unity in John 17. Therefore, conflict should not surprise us. Nevertheless, our response is clear: love. Love covers a multitude of sins (1 Peter 4:8), and it is better to be wronged than to retaliate (1 Corinthians 6:7).

If there are unresolved issues within the group, the devil has gained a foothold. In such a case, the group may as well be closed, and the members not involved in the dispute should contact us so that we can help them join another group. Those who cannot love a brother—even when they have been wronged—are not yet of sufficient spiritual maturity for this work.

The facilitator should do everything in his power to reconcile the brothers involved. However, if there is clear and persistent violation of our distinctives or a refusal to pursue peace, the facilitator should ask the perpetrator to step aside. If the facilitator himself is failing to uphold our distinctives, please contact us and we will seek to resolve the matter.`
  },
  {
    title: "If I join should I tell my elders?",
    text: `Yes, it is strongly advised that you speak to your elders, who hold spiritual authority over you. Let them know whom you will be meeting with, as well as when and where, and be willing to answer any questions they may have. If they would like to contact us, we would be more than willing to speak with them.`
