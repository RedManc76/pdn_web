                <h2 class="subtitle">It is not intended to dictate the structure by which each group is organised, but there are some guidelines that can aid in the effectiveness of their ministry. Therefore, it is strongly advised that these guidelines be taken seriously and only deviated from should it be clear that another approach is necessary or would in all likelihood be more effective. </h2>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Time</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">A time needs to be chosen that will permit the group to meet unhindered by the changing schedule of everyday life. Those who commit to this work must realise the primacy of meeting together. It's a commitment not to each other but to the Lord. The group is not scheduling to meet each other but to meet the Lord. If a meeting with the monarch of England was scheduled and any request granted, nothing but a life-threatening emergency would keep us from it. How much more, the great King of Heaven? For this reason, it is advised to pick a time when interruptions are least likely to occur. Generally, a time between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. would facilitate this. Our Lord was accustomed to meeting with his Father during these hours. If this seems too extreme, this may not be the correct path for you right now.</h2>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Frequency</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">The frequency with which the group meets is also of primary importance. The group must be committed to meeting regularly and often, but it is very easy for our sinful human frame to fall into asceticism and self-righteousness. Self-denial is an important aspect of the Christian life, but it must be Holy Spirit-led and not imposed on people. We therefore must be mindful of new members joining the group who may not be as far down that line of self-denial as are others. It is therefore strongly advised to meet once a week, with the option of more established groups meeting more regularly at times of intense warfare.</h2>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Duration</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">The length of each meeting will depend on various factors, e.g., the size of the group, the frequency of meetings, the individual's personal schedule, and the season of prayer the Lord has the group in. Again, the danger of asceticism is more than likely to creep in. Therefore, it is strongly advised that meetings last somewhere between one and two hours. The length of the meeting may be changed at any time to facilitate what the Lord is doing. It is also strongly advised that, if any length of discussion is allowed in the meeting, meeting lengths should increase proportionately. It is suggested that any lengthy discussion be saved for another time so that the meeting can be given primarily to prayer. </h2>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Location</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">Ideally, the group would meet in person, or at least as many as possible with others online. However, in today's society, with our personal connections extending beyond our local regions, it is not always possible. Therefore, meeting online can be a useful tool. It is strongly advised that using a non-subscription platform that limits the time of the meeting is unsuitable for this work. The distraction of such an interruption could destroy the flow of the meeting. </h2>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Size</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">Each group will consist of a group leader and a number of disciples. It is important that every member of the group has equal opportunity to express themselves in prayer, and this therefore limits the size of the group. An ideal group will therefore aim to have between 3 and 6 disciples at any one time. Lord willing, by the time more disciples are presented for training, one of the established members of the group will be ready to take on the role of leading a new group themselves. </h2>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Constitution</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">It is not necessary that the groups be single-sexed, although there may be some advantage to that being the case, and careful consideration should be given in each situation. One of the disadvantages of having both males and females in the group is female leadership. The biblical mandate is for male leadership where there is spiritual authority, but as the leaders do not carry spiritual authority, female leadership is not expressly forbidden. That being said, the role of male leadership is ubiquitous in the scriptures, so this is highly recommended in almost all situations, unless absolutely inevitable.</h2>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Ecumenicism</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">Group leaders need to be wise when adding disciples to the group so that they will not disrupt established group members. All members need to be aware that the group is not a place to discuss or promote their theological perspectives either. Of course, our understanding of scripture affects our prayers, and leniency must be extended for people to pray as their consciences dictate. After all, they are petitioning God, not the other members, and God is quite capable of overlooking theological infractions to see the heart behind the prayer, so the same grace should be extended by others. Ecumenicism within the bounds of Bible-believing Christians is not only biblical but essential to wonder-working, mountain-moving prayer. </h2>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Recruitment</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">The recruitment of disciples is of the utmost importance. Individuals need to have certain spiritual dispositions so that they are integrally wedded to the purposes and goals of this work. There is no doubt that should the Lord use this work as a means of advancing his kingdom, his enemy, the Devil, will seek to destroy it. The primary means of his attack is to cause people to lose heart or incite division. Part of the prayer system is included to combat this very great threat, but without adequate prudence in choosing those joining a group, it will be extremely difficult to stop. The philosophy with regards to recruitment is that God chooses and anoints individuals for the work. So it is the leader's responsibility to assess candidates and discern the mind of the Lord. It would be folly to leave this down to human wisdom, so the first role of the prayer system is dedicated to seeking God's divine help in selecting individuals.</h2>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Conspicuity</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">Because God will be the one selecting new recruits, it is strongly urged that the work not be publicised and that extreme caution be exercised when discussing it with anyone who is not currently involved. Many people are drawn to prayer initiatives, which are frequently shown to be works of the flesh, and any initial passion rapidly fades. This task requires a calling and anointing, as well as faith in God that those who are called will be revealed clearly and unmistakably.</h2>
                
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Promotion</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">As the goal for each disciple is to become the leader of their own group, there needs to be a procedure for this transition. It would usually be preferred that a small group reach capacity before dividing into two separate groups, with one of the established disciples becoming the leader of the new group. However, a leader may lead multiple groups if they have the capacity. A new leader should consider attending their parent group on a regular basis at first. A suggestion of fortnightly or monthly would not be unreasonable.</h2>
                <h2 class="subtitle">Choosing a leader is one of the most critical decisions that can be made. As that leader could directly or indirectly occasion many groups, their zeal and conformity to our distinctives being heavily dependent on the new leaders zeal and conformity. To lose our distinctives is to end the Prayer Disciples Academy, and therefore, it would be better to limit growth or pass on new members to other groups than prematurely promote. </h2>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Accountability</button>
            <div class="panel">
                
                <h2 class="subtitle">As stated above, each group acts autonomously and is accountable to the Lord only. However, a loose connection between groups would facilitate mutual encouragement. This will be available through this website, set up for this specific task. Reports can be left for the edification of others, finding a group for new disciples, and advertising organised events. An event can include regional or national conferences or prayer gatherings. It is encouraged that each group register online so that they can be kept informed, but it is not necessary. Each group, whether they are registered or not, should use this website. Regularly reminding themselves of our distinctives and using the prayer list and documents.</h2>
