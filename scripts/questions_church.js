    text: `It is not intended to dictate the structure by which each group is organised, but there are some guidelines that can aid in the effectiveness of their ministry. Therefore, it is strongly advised that these guidelines be taken seriously and only deviated from should it be clear that another approach is necessary or would in all likelihood be more effective.`,

    title: "What is the PDA?",
    text: `The Prayer Discipleship Academy is a framework through which the Holy Spirit trains men and women to pray and develops in them a serious devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ.

For more detail, please watch all our introductory videos and familiarise yourself with our distinctives and structure.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What part does Scripture play?",
    text: `Although the PDA is a "prayer" discipleship academy, Scripture plays a crucial role. We focus on prayer because it is an essential element in understanding and applying the word. However, without the word, we would not know what to pray or the God through whom we pray. Prayer is ineffective without the word, and the word is incomplete without prayer. To be effective in both word and prayer, we must grow in both.

The reason the PDA does not include teaching or training in the word is that this is the responsibility of your elders. Additionally, there are many valuable resources available today for biblical studies. However, there are very few initiatives that train men and women in prayer, and so this is our focus.

Through the guidance of the Holy Spirit within the PDA framework, you will be led into a deeper devotional life, rooted in personal devotion to both the word and prayer. You will become more intimately connected with the word through reading, studying, meditation, and memorization, making it an integral part of your life. Your prayer life will be enriched and more effective, thereby maximizing the fruitfulness of your time spent in the Bible.`,

    title: "Requirements for members?",
    text: `Agree with and hold to the Statement of Faith.

Be a born-again, baptised believer and a member in good standing of a Bible-believing, Trinitarian church.

Commit to attending each small group meeting (Distinctive One).

Commit to attending each large group meeting when able.

Commit to the Spirit’s sanctifying work and to the personal development necessary to become a serious man or woman of prayer (Distinctive Two).

Commit to implementing Total War and seeking the Lord’s help to progressively apply it in your Christian walk (Distinctive Three).`,
  },
  {
    title: "What time should we prayer?",
    text: `A time should be chosen that allows the small group to meet without interference from daily responsibilities. The commitment is ultimately to the Lord, not merely to one another. Just as no one would miss a meeting with an earthly monarch except in a life-threatening emergency, how much more should we prioritise meeting with the King of Heaven? A time between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. is recommended, as our Lord often met with His Father during these hours.

Once a time is set, it should not be changed unless circumstances genuinely require it and a more profitable time is chosen. At all costs, we must avoid changing the meeting time on an ad hoc basis, as this undermines our first distinctive of sacrificial commitment—even when it causes personal inconvenience or discomfort. If this seems too extreme, then this path may not be right for you at this time.

Large group meeting times will be set and published by the elders`,
  },
  {
    title: "How often should we pray?",
    text: `Small groups must meet regularly, though care must be taken to avoid asceticism and self-righteousness. Self-denial is important but must be Spirit-led, not imposed. Members may be at different stages of growth, so meeting once a week is strongly advised, with the possibility of more frequent meetings for established groups during times of intense spiritual warfare.

Large group meeting can be as frequent as weekly, fortnightly or even monthly, depending on the elders discretion`,
  },
  {
    title: "What duration should the meeting be?",
    text: `The length of each small meeting depends on group size, meeting frequency, schedules, and the season of prayer. Because ascetic tendencies can emerge, meetings are best kept between one and two hours. Length may be adjusted when necessary. If significant discussion is included, meeting length should increase proportionally. Ideally, long discussions should be held at another time so that meetings can focus primarily on prayer.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Where should we meet?",
    text: `Meeting in person is ideal, though online gatherings are acceptable when distance makes in-person meetings impractical. However, using platforms with time limits is strongly discouraged, as forced interruptions can disrupt the flow and effectiveness of prayer.

It is imperative that you only meet with individuals you personally know and whose character you are confident in. As groups are decided by the elders, this will likely have been consider already`,
  },
  {
    title: "What size should a group be?",
    text: `Groups should consist of two to four people. This ensures everyone can participate meaningfully in prayer.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Who can be a member?",
    text: `Anybody who holds to our Statement of Faith, is a member in good standing with the church, and has committed to abide by our distinctives. They must also have been approved by the elders`,
  },
  {
    title: "What about theological distinctives?",
    text: `Members must refrain from promoting theological positions within the group. While doctrinal understanding influences prayer, grace should be extended, remembering that members are praying to God, not to each other. Ecumenicism among Bible-believing Christians is biblical and essential for powerful, effective prayer.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Should groups be single-sex?",
    text: `Groups do not need to be single-sex, though there may be advantages to doing so. Some prayer topics might not be appropriate in mixed groups. In addition, unmarried individuals of the opposite sex should not meet in person alone—and preferably not online either—unless it is clearly evident that this would not present any issues and it has been approved by the elders.`,
  },
  {
    title: "How should people be recruited?",
    text: `The recruitment of members is the job of the elders. They should select individuals that possess the spiritual dispositions that align with the purpose of the work. Prayer for God’s direction is therefore foundational to the recruitment process.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Should we publicise the work?",
    text: `It is up to the elders whether they are happy for members to invite others, or whether they would prefer to publicise it themselves.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Can people be removed?",
    text: `To continue in the work, each member must continue to uphold our Statement of Faith and maintain our distinctives.

If the elders determine that one or more of these requirements is no longer being met, they have the right to prevent that person from attending further meetings. It is not our desire for this to occur, and there may be many reasons why a member is struggling in one or more areas. In such cases, the elders should exercise grace tempered with wisdom.

If, after a reasonable period of grace, a member still fails to uphold thes requirements, the preferred approach is a mutual agreement for them to step down. However, if they refuse to do so, the elders will ask them to leave until they are able to continue while meeting the necessary requirements.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What if I can no longer continue?",
    text: `There may be circumstances beyond a member’s control that prevent them from upholding our distinctives. As much as we would like for that member to continue with us, the effectiveness of this work depends entirely on our distinctives, which maintain the spiritual framework essential for the ministry. Therefore, it may be necessary for that member to step aside temporarily, with the hope that circumstances will change and they can rejoin the work in the future.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What is the spiritual accountability?",
    text: `To the elders: They are solely responsible for spiritual authority. Any issues, questions, or concerns should be directed to them.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Where can I report problems?",
    text: `It is to be expected that as this work bears fruit for the kingdom, our adversary the devil will seek to disrupt it. His primary target is the interpersonal relationships between Christians—hence our Lord’s prayer for unity in John 17. Therefore, conflict should not surprise us. Nevertheless, our response is clear: love. Love covers a multitude of sins (1 Peter 4:8), and it is better to be wronged than to retaliate (1 Corinthians 6:7).

If there are unresolved issues the elders should do everything in his power to reconcile the brothers involved. However, if there is clear and persistent violation of our distinctives or a refusal to pursue peace, the elders should ask the perpetrator to step aside.`,
