        text: `Bring us into greater intimacy with your Holy Spirit; Grant us the mind of Christ and break our hearts for what breaks yours.

Help us to appreciate your precious intimate presence and guard it jealously with all of our being and strength.

Share Christ's intercession by his Spirit, concerning those things he wants to do in and through us.`,

        title: "Prayer of Faith",
        text: `Grant us faith so that we might trust your leading, know your hearing and expect your answers.

Cause our faith to be steadfast and sure, not faltering or ceasing before we have what we are asking for.

Lord, cause our faith to grow as we witness increasingly powerful answers to our prayers.`,

    {
        title: "Vessels of Prayer",
        text: `Make us holy and vessels fit for the Master's use by the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit.

Give us a hatred of those things in our lives that hinder prayer and cause us to fall upon your mercy until they are eradicated.

Give us a greater zeal to see our brothers grow in faith and prayer and be mighty used for Christ's glory.`,

    {
        title: "Power of Prayer",

Protect our unity in prayer from the schemes of the evil one.`,

        title: "Prayer Academy",
        text: `Our church ministry is profoundly impacted by prayer. God's kingdom is established and Satan's influence brought to nothing through the power of the gospel.

Our church grows in love, holiness, and power. Sinners are to be added to the church, discipled, and sent out. More members commit themselves to serious and sacrificial prayer.

Other churches adopt PDA and the Lord greatly blesses their use of it.`,

    {
        title: "Prayer Outworking",
        text: `The gospel to go out not only in word but in power, transforming lives, pulling down strongholds, and glorifying Christ.

The Church in our nation turns from her idols of ease and comfort and pursues the glory of Christ with all vigour and zeal.

Revival in our nation: the kingdom of Christ advanced, and the kingdom of darkness crushed under the foot of the church with Christ seen victorious as its head.`,
