            <div class="panel">

                <h2 class="subtitle">It is not our intention to dictate precisely how each group should be organized, but there are guidelines that can aid in the effectiveness of their ministry. These guidelines should be taken seriously, and deviation should only occur when it is clear that another approach is necessary or would likely be more effective. </h2>

            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Time</button>
            <div class="panel">

                <h2 class="subtitle">A time should be chosen that allows the group to meet unhindered by the changing schedule of daily life. Those who commit to this work must recognise the primacy of meeting together—not for each other, but for the Lord. The group meets to meet the Lord, not merely to meet one another. Consider: if the monarch of England invited us to meet regularly and promised to grant anything we requested to advance Christ’s kingdom, nothing but a life-threatening emergency would keep us from attending. How much more should we honour the King eternal? For this reason, it is advised to select a time when interruptions are least likely. Generally, a time between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. is recommended, following the example of our Lord, who often met with His Father during these hours. If this seems too extreme, this may not be the correct path for you at this time.</h2>

            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Frequency</button>
            <div class="panel">

                <h2 class="subtitle">The frequency of meetings is of primary importance. The group must be committed to meeting regularly, but care must be taken to avoid falling into asceticism or self-righteousness. Self-denial is an important part of the Christian life, but it must be Holy Spirit-led, not imposed. New members may not yet be accustomed to rigorous self-denial, so it is strongly advised that groups meet once or twice a week, with the option for more established groups to meet more frequently during periods of intense spiritual warfare.</h2>

            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Duration</button>
            <div class="panel">

                <h2 class="subtitle">Meeting length depends on factors such as group size, meeting frequency, members’ personal schedules, and the current season of prayer. To prevent asceticism from creeping in, meetings are recommended to last between 30 and 90 minutes. Meeting length can be adjusted as needed to accommodate the work of the Lord. If discussion is allowed during meetings, time should be increased proportionally, though it is suggested that lengthy discussions be saved for another time to prioritise prayer.</h2>

            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Location</button>
            <div class="panel">

                <h2 class="subtitle">Ideally, groups meet in person, or as many as possible together online. In today’s society, online meetings can be a useful alternative. It is strongly advised to avoid non-subscription platforms that limit meeting time, as interruptions can disrupt the flow of prayer.</h2>

            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Size</button>
            <div class="panel">

                <h2 class="subtitle">While there is no limit to the number of church members participating in the PDA, members should be divided into small groups meeting at least once a week. Each member must have equal opportunity to pray, which limits group size. Ideally, groups should consist of 2–4 members.</h2>

            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Constitution</button>
            <div class="panel">

                <h2 class="subtitle">Groups need not be single-sex, though there may be some advantages in certain situations. Mixed groups of only two members are highly discouraged, especially for in-person meetings. Elders should be aware of each group’s composition.</h2>

            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Ecumenicism</button>
            <div class="panel">

                <h2 class="subtitle">Members must understand that the group is not a forum for debating or promoting personal theological perspectives. Prayer may reflect individual understanding of Scripture, and grace should be extended as God sees the heart behind prayer. However, the elders remain responsible for setting doctrinal standards, and theological positions should align with the local church’s guidance.</h2>

            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Recruitment</button>
            <div class="panel">

                <h2 class="subtitle">When adding church members, leaders must ensure that each individual is capable of operating within the PDA Church framework. The enemy will seek to destroy this work, primarily by causing discouragement or division. Elders must prayerfully assess candidates to discern their suitability for participation.</h2>

            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Conspicuity</button>
            <div class="panel">

                <h2 class="subtitle">Many are initially drawn to prayer initiatives, but initial passion often fades. Therefore, promotion of this work should not be overly conspicuous. Elders, familiar with their members, are best placed to identify who is likely to benefit from and contribute to the work. Absolute secrecy is not required, and care should be taken to avoid creating an air of elitism.</h2>
