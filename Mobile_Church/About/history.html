            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>The Prayer Discipleship Academy (PDA) was first conceived around 2018, when two Christian men—one from
                England and the other from the USA—were meeting regularly for prayer concerning our nations and a new,
                necessary move of God in this time of great declension. The brother from the USA has since departed to
                be with the Lord, but by that time, the brother in England was discipling a serious young man from
                across the border in Scotland.</h3>
            <h3>Prayer formed the nucleus of this discipleship, and the fruitfulness of this prayer was evident. The
                approach was simple but effective, and from this, the idea was born to expand the work. Not wanting to
                move ahead presumptuously, time was set aside for prayer and fasting. Initially, the PDA was established
                as a para-church structure operating externally to a local church, and it has run successfully in this
                form ever since.</h3>
            <h3>However, in late 2025, a local pastor—after being invited to join the PDA—saw an opportunity to run the
                PDA as a para-church structure within the context of a local church, facilitating prayer discipleship
                among church members under the care of the eldership. The advantages and potential of this approach were
                clear, and prayerful work was undertaken to reorganize the structure of the PDA, giving rise to PDA
                Church.</h3>
