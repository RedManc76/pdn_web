            <h2>Small Meeting Structure</h2>
            <h3>The specifics of each prayer meeting are determined by the members of that group. However, to maintain
                conformity with our distinctives, each meeting should focus on three main goals. Adequate time should be
                devoted to each goal, though priorities may vary from meeting to meeting.</h3>
            <h3><b>Goal One</b></h3>
            <h3>Seek the Lord’s help for each member of the group to grow in holiness and in love for one another. Pray
                that each person may be fully equipped for their calling and ministry and may grow in power, zeal, and
                effectiveness in prayer.</h3>
            <h3><b>Goal Two</b></h3>
            <h3>Intercede for the needs of group members and for matters pertaining to their lives and ministries.</h3>
            <h3><b>Goal Three</b></h3>
            <h3>Intercede for the needs and mission of the church.</h3>

            <h2>Group Meeting Structure</h2>
            <h3>Group meetings are led by an elder or a representative of the elders. These meetings serve to:</h3>
            <h3>Discuss prayer answers, struggles, and the focus of each small group.</h3>
            <h3>Leverage the prayers of the entire group for small group issues where necessary.</h3>
            <h3>Provide guidance and instructions to the small groups on how to pray for the church ministry.</h3>

            <h2>Prayer Lists</h2>
            <h3>In order to try and maintain a good and healthy balance between all three goals, we have produced three
                prayer lists.</h3>
            <h3><b>ARPT</b></h3>
            <h3>The American Revival Prayer Trip (ARPT) is the founding prayer list for this work. In 2015, the founder
                of the PDA—driven by a love for Christ and a desire to see Him glorified again in the UK—wrote these
                prayers. The list consists of eight subjects, each containing between seven and twelve individual
                prayers. It is not expedient to pray through an entire section during meetings, as this would leave
                insufficient time for other matters. However, selected prayers from the ARPT may be especially useful
                for personal devotion or focused times of group prayer. </h3>
            <h3><b>Scripture</b></h3>
            <h3>The second list is made up of selected prayers from scripture taken from the Desiring God website. It is
                similar to the ARPT and, therefore, could be used in a similar manner.</h3>
            <h3><b>Essentials</b></h3>
            <h3>The PDA Essential Prayer List provides a condensed version of the ARPT. It contains seven sections, each
                with only three prayers. Though not comprehensive, this list is sufficient to cover our three meeting
                goals and, if prayed through regularly, will keep the group aligned with our purpose. Using one section
                each time the group meets would be a reasonable expectation.</h3>
            <h3>All prayer lists can be viewed on the website or downloaded in PDF format from the documents section.
            </h3>

            <h2>Scripture</h2>
            <h3>To lay a firm foundation for the prayer meeting, we begin with Scripture. We therefore recommend a short Scripture reading drawn from three categories:</h3>
                <h3>1. Our sinful state without Christ</h3>
                <h3>2. Christ's work in reconciliation</h3>
                <h3>3. The blessings we now enjoy in prayer</h3>
            <h3>A member should choose a single text from each category and read them aloud before prayer begins. While
                the use of Scripture is important, the group may decide how best to incorporate these readings into the
                meeting.</h3>
