            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-text">The Prayer Discipleship Academy (PDA) was first conceived around 2018, when two Christian men—one from England and the other from the USA—were meeting regularly for prayer concerning our nations and a new, necessary move of God in this time of great declension. The brother from the USA has since departed to be with the Lord, but by that time, the brother in England was discipling a serious young man from across the border in Scotland.

Prayer formed the nucleus of this discipleship, and the fruitfulness of this prayer was evident. The approach was simple but effective, and from this, the idea was born to expand the work. Not wanting to move ahead presumptuously, time was set aside for prayer and fasting. Initially, the PDA was established as a para-church structure operating externally to a local church, and it has run successfully in this form ever since.

However, in late 2025, a local pastor—after being invited to join the PDA—saw an opportunity to run the PDA as a para-church structure within the context of a local church, facilitating prayer discipleship among church members under the care of the eldership. The advantages and potential of this approach were clear, and prayerful work was undertaken to reorganize the structure of the PDA, giving rise to PDA Church.
