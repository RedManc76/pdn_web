                <div class="content-text">Prayer Discipleship Academy (PDA) is a para-church ministry that operates within, and under the oversight of, a local church. It functions only with the authorisation of the elders and exists to support their desire to help the congregation grow in prayer.

PDA, and any of its representatives, hold no authority—spiritual, pastoral, or organisational. All authority rests solely with the church’s elders.

The conduct of church members remains fully subject to the rules, policies, and leadership of their local church. Nothing taught, encouraged, or practiced within PDA should be taken to override, replace, or contradict the church’s established leadership or guidelines.

Any questions, concerns, pastoral matters, or issues of doctrine or practice should be directed to your church elders as you would ordinarily.

1. Not a replacement for pastoral care
“PDA does not replace personal pastoral care, counselling, or discipleship provided by the local church.”

2. Teachings are subject to elder oversight
“All teaching within PDA is intended to align with the doctrine and practice of the local church and is subject to the review and correction of the elders.”

3. Attendance is voluntary
“Participation in PDA is voluntary and should not be seen as a requirement for membership or spiritual standing within the church.”

4. Not responsible for decisions made by attendees
“Any personal, spiritual, or practical decisions made by attendees remain their own responsibility and should be discussed with their church leaders where appropriate.”

6. Confidentiality / safeguarding
“Matters requiring pastoral intervention, safeguarding, or church discipline will always be referred back to the elders.”</div>
