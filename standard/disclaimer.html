            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-title">Safety and Responsibility</div>
                <div class="content-text">We have designed a biblical structure intended to help you grow spiritually, particularly in the area of prayer. However, we are unable to take responsibility for your personal or spiritual safety. As facilitators develop organically within this work, we have no reliable means of determining their spiritual maturity, character, or suitability. Therefore, it is absolutely imperative that you take responsibility for your own safety and conduct yourself with wisdom.

            <!-- SECTION 2 -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-title">Church Oversight</div>
                <div class="content-text">We strongly advise that your church elders are aware of your involvement, that you remain under their spiritual oversight, and that you follow any counsel they provide. Should any suspicion or concern arise at any time, you must inform them immediately.
                </div>

            <!-- SECTION 3 -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-title">Meeting Guidelines</div>
                <div class="content-text">If meeting in person, it is essential that you meet only with individuals you know personally and whose character you trust. You should never meet alone in person with someone of the opposite sex to whom you are not married, and we advise similar caution even online unless it is unquestionably appropriate.
                </div>

            <!-- SECTION 4 -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-title">Discernment</div>
                <div class="content-text">While we encourage doctrinal faithfulness, we cannot guarantee the beliefs, maturity, or practices of every facilitator or participant. You must exercise discernment at all times, testing all things according to Scripture.
                </div>

                <div class="content-title">Church Authority</div>
                <div class="content-text">These groups are not designed to replace the pastoral oversight of your local church. They do not substitute for the authority, care, or discipline of your elders, but serve only as a supplement to your existing church life and responsibilities.

            <!-- SECTION 6 -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-title">Support for Vulnerable Individuals</div>
                <div class="content-text">Individuals who are vulnerable, at risk, or in emotional or spiritual distress should seek appropriate pastoral or professional support. These groups are not a replacement for proper safeguarding procedures, pastoral care, counselling, or crisis assistance.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- SECTION 7 -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-title">Personal Information</div>
                <div class="content-text">Please be mindful of what personal information you share within any group setting. We cannot take responsibility for how other individuals may use or handle information you disclose. Always use wisdom and discretion.

            <!-- SECTION 8 -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-title">Voluntary Participation</div>
                <div class="content-text">Participation in these groups is entirely voluntary. By taking part, you acknowledge that you do so at your own discretion, and we cannot accept liability for any harm, loss, conflict, or disagreement arising from your involvement.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- SECTION 9 -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-title">Conduct</div>
                <div class="content-text">Our aim is to promote spiritual growth, unity, and earnest prayer. We expect all facilitators and participants to walk in love, humility, and repentance. Where interpersonal conflict persists without resolution, the work is hindered, and individuals unwilling to pursue reconciliation may be asked to step away for the good of the group.
