            <!-- SECTION 1 -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-text">In June 2015, a trip to the USA was conducted to eight prominent sites
                    connected with North American revivals. The trip was carried out with the purpose of petitioning the
                    almighty God for revival again in the United Kingdom. The trip was named the American Revival Prayer
                    Trip, and this name was also used for the associated prayer lists recording the actual prayer
                    petitions in each location.

                    Several years later, this prayer list was shared with a retired pastor, and regular prayer meetings
                    were held. A decision was considered to form a conventional prayer meeting of UK and American
                    pastors for national revival, and work was undertaken to formalise the prayers of the ARPT for
                    discipleship training. During the early stages of planning, the Lord took this servant home and
                    appeared to close the door on the proposed work.

                    By this time, another meeting was in session with a young convert using the ARPT as a means of
                    prayer discipleship. The vision of a prayer initiative seeking the Lord for another outpouring was
                    at the forefront throughout, but not wanting to precede the Lord and being very careful that nothing
                    was done in the arm of the flesh, it was committed to much prayer.

                    The success of prayer discipleship linked to the ARPT in that young man was evident. It was simple
                    but effective, and from this, the idea was born to franchise the work. Again, not wanting to go
                    before the Lord, time was set aside for prayer and fasting. After this, a preliminary document was
                    collated, and the two men asked God to send another person for discipleship. The following day,
                    another person, unaware of the request to God, showed a desire to join a prayer meeting. This was
                    the final confirmation to launch the Prayer Discipleship Academy.

                    The PDA is an extension of ARPT and is believed to be God's answer to at least five of the prayer
                    requests listed within it. These are listed below:

                    1. Raising up of intercessors in their own area of influence so that our country is saturated in
                    prayer.

                    2. That the Holy Spirit leads me into deeper and more powerful ministry in prayer.

                    3. God to raise up prayer leaders and coordinators.

                    4. People longing to be discipled, and godly people do it.

                    5. A desire that men and women of like passion be raised up, and a sacrificial heart to encourage
                    them.
