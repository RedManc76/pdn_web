        <p style="color: black;">We do not desire to turn anyone away from seeking to grow in their prayer life. Therefore there is no level to which a Christian must have obtained before joining us in our warfare. Other than affirming our statement of faith and being a baptised believer of a bible beleiving trinitarian church. That being said however and i am sure you have probably realised as you've looked at our matterial that this work is of the most serious nature and nothing short of a total commitment to the cause of Christ and a willingness to be used as he see fit in this endeavour. It is a sad day for the church that this should have to be mentioned as this is not the description of a 'super' Christian but an entry level. Sadly many fall short of this standard and therefore we ask that you exmaine yourself carefully</p>
        <p stlye="color: black;">If you have not already please read the total warfare menifesto. We don't expect any Christian to have implmented total war in the entirety of their lives but we do expect that each person that joins us makes a commitment to its ideals and with the power of the Spirit increasing implement and grow in it</p>
