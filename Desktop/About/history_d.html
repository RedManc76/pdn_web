            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>In June 2015, a trip to the USA was conducted to eight prominent sites connected with North American revivals. The trip was carried out with the purpose of petitioning the almighty God for revival again in the United Kingdom. The trip was named the American Revival Prayer Trip, and this name was also used for the associated prayer lists recording the actual prayer petitions in each location. </h3>
            <h3>Several years later, this prayer list was shared with a retired pastor, and regular prayer meetings were held. A decision was considered to form a conventional prayer meeting of UK and American pastors for national revival, and work was undertaken to formalise the prayers of the ARPT for discipleship training. During the early stages of planning, the Lord took this servant home and appeared to close the door on the proposed work. </h3>
            <h3>By this time, another meeting was in session with a young convert using the ARPT as a means of prayer discipleship. The vision of a prayer initiative seeking the Lord for another outpouring was at the forefront throughout. but, not wanting to precede the Lord and being very careful that nothing was done in the arm of the flesh, it was committed to much prayer. </h3>
            <h3>The success of prayer discipleship linked to the ARPT in that young man was evident. It was simple but effective, and from this, the idea was born to franchise the work. Again, not wanting to go before the Lord, time was set aside for prayer and fasting. After this, a preliminary document was collated, and the two men asked God to send another person for discipleship. The following day, another person, unaware of the request to God, showed a desire to join a prayer meeting. This was the final confirmation to launch the Prayer Discipleship Academy. </h3>
            <h3>The PDA is an extension of ARPT and is believed to be God's answer to at least five of the prayer requests listed within it. These are listed below.</h3>
            <h3>1. Raising up of intercessors in their own area of influence so that our country is saturated in prayer.</h3>
            <h3>2. That the Holy Spirit leads me into deeper and more powerful ministry in prayer.</h3>
            <h3>3. God to raise up prayer leaders and coordinators.</h3>
            <h3>4. People longing to be discipled, and godly people do it.</h3>
            <h3>5. A desire that men and women of like passion be raised up, and a sacrificial heart to encourage them.</h3>
