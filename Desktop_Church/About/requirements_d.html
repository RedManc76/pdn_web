            <h1>Philosophy</h1>
            <h3>Our philosophy is simple and biblical: discipline and sacrificial commitment. The latter is not possible without the former, and no mighty work of God has ever been accomplished without it. Search the Scriptures and church history, and you will find both in notable abundance among those who have achieved much for the Lord. Why? Because there is greatness in the person—no, because these are the vessels most fit for the Master’s use.</h3>
            <h3>This philosophy is reflected in our three distinctives.</h3>

            <h1>Distinctive One</h1>
            <h3>We are primarily committing to meet with the Lord, not with each other. We believe there is a special blessing from the Lord in making this commitment and faithfully keeping it. God honours the person who keeps their commitment, even when it is difficult.</h3>
            <h3><i>O LORD, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy hill? …. who honours those who
                    fear the LORD; <b>who swears to his own hurt and does not change</b>; Ps 15:1-4</h3></i></h3>
            <h3>Imagine if the King of England invited us to come before him regularly and promised to grant anything we asked to advance the kingdom of Christ in our nation. What would prevent us from accepting the invitation? What priority would we assign to it? Would we dare snub him because of ordinary circumstances or the busyness of life? How much more should we honour the King eternal and only wise God?</h3>
            <h3>If you commit to this undertaking, the cost will grow exponentially. We will not see the end of abortion, sexual immorality, or false religion, without much pain and the loss of many comforts and freedoms, some may even be called to give their lives. We are putting ourselves on the front lines, and as such, we become primary targets for the devil and his forces. Therefore, if we are not prepared to pay the initial cost of meeting the Lord regularly, we are not suited for the work or the consequences it entails.</h3>

            <h1>Distinctive Two</h1>
            <h3>The vast majority of the modern church is unprepared for the extent of spiritual warfare necessary to see the gates of hell torn down, and even the most diligent often fall far short of the standard set by the men and women who achieved much in church history.</h3>
            <h3>External enforcement of strict discipline, or attempts to summon resolve from within, may appear effective for a time, but they will ultimately fail. Such approaches leave us vulnerable to one of the devil’s schemes: self-reliance, self-righteousness, or discouragement. No, if we are to become fit for the Lord’s use in this day, it must be solely through the help and guidance of the Holy Spirit. This is why discipleship must be initiated, sustained, and crowned by prayer.</h3>
            <h3>With the Spirit’s help, each person who commits to this work also commits to the rigorous discipline necessary to achieve spiritual readiness. No area of life is off-limits, and no cost is too great. Attrition is inevitable in the training of elite soldiers; while we desire that all who embark on this path continue with us, there is simply no place for those unwilling to count the cost.</h3>
            <h3>Since none of this can be accomplished by our own willingness or power, our meetings and prayers are structured to invite the living God to work in and through us.</h3>

            <h1>Distinctive Three</h1>
            <h3>As previously stated, we are in a war, and priorities in times of war differ significantly from those in times of peace. Not only are we at war, but in our day and nation, we have been driven back and are sorely pressed. If we are to be effective in our counterattack, we must adopt priorities that are fitting for our time and circumstances.</h3>
            <h3>Our goal is a commitment to “Total War”, though we must acknowledge that we will fall short. This, however, is not an excuse to remain stagnant; rather, it is a call to strive with ever-increasing effort, relying on the Spirit of God, to grow daily in conformity to this goal. The rigor with which we subject ourselves to this process will be proportional to our love for God and our desire to see Christ glorified. This must be a daily matter of prayer.</h3>
